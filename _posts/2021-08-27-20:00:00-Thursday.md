Using MathJax components from a CDN on the web  
If you are loading MathJax from a CDN into a web page, there is no need to install anything.  
Simply use a script tag that loads MathJax from the CDN. E.g.,  
""<script id="MathJax-script" async  
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">  
</script>"  
All that is needed to get an equation to display on a web page is:
the script tag above and $$latex code$$
Such as "$$y=x^{3}$$" yields  
$$y=x^{3}$$
