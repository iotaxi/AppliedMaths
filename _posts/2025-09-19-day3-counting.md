Day 3

NOTATION  
$$n!$$ is read as n factorian and is defined as:  
$$n!=(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(2)(1)$$  
and $$0!=1$$  
where n is a non-negative integer.  

RECALL THAT:
The number of arrangements of k objects chosen from a collection of n objects, where each object may be used just once is: $$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)$$  
But  
$$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)=\frac{(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots\cdots(1)}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots\cdots(1)}$$  
$$=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$  

THE SUBTRACTION PRINCIPLE  
Suppose again that we have a collection of objects.  
 
$$\#\,of\,objects\,that\,satisfy\,some\,condition$$

$$=total\,\#\,of\,objects-\#\,that\,dont\,satisfy\,the\,condition$$

where \# is read as number

After Day 3, our take away message is:  
<span style="color:blue">$$n!=(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(2)(1)$$</span>     
<span style="color:blue">$$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$</span>     
<span style="color:blue">THE SUBTRACTION PRINCIPLE</span>  
Problems  
Some problems on arrangements are straightforward. Simply calculate $$n!$$ or $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$    
In other problems, we get variations such as  
(i) things are to be kept together or  
(ii) there are restrictions or   
(iii) things are to be kept separated or  
(iv) repetitions are allowed
