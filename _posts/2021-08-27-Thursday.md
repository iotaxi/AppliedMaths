The best solution todate for blog. Write text and equations in LYX.
Each equation should be on a new line. Export as plain LaTex. Edit
in Notepad++. Remove any additions to basic LaTex and surround each
equation with double dollar signs. Cut and paste to .md blog file
(Jekyll Minima, GitHub).  
$$\frac{a}{b}\text{Press "ctrl+m" to make a text box. Enter your text}$$  
$$\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$  
$$\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n}{n-k}$$  
$$\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k}+\binom{n-1}{k-1}$$  
$$(a+b)^{n}=\binom{n}{0}a^{n}+\binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b+etc$$  
$$2^{n}=\binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}+...$$  
This is text before the last equation:  
$$\binom{n}{0}+...=\binom{n}{1}+...$$  
This is text after the last equation.
