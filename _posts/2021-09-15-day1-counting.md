How To Count

Day 1  
Learn How to Count before studying Probability and then Statistics.  
Work through this programme and then return to the same topics some time later to consolidate your understanding.  

How many integers are there between 1 and 10, inclusive of both 1 and 10?  
The answer is clearly 10.  

How many integers are there between 1 and n, inclusive of both 1 and n?
The answer is n.  

How many integers are there between k and n, inclusive of both k and n, where k\<n?  
Between 1 and n, there are n integers.  
We must subtract the number of integers between 1 and k-1, if we wish to include k in our final answer.  
Between 1 and k-1, there are k-1 integers.  
So between k and n, inclusive of the endpoints, there are $$n-(k-1)$$ integers.  

But $$n-(k-1)=n-k+1$$  

After Day1, our take away message is that inclusive of endpoints: 

<span style="color:blue"> $$\text{The number of integers between k and n is  }n-k+1$$</span>.
