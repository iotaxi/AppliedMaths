How To Count

Day 1  
Learn How to Count before studying Probability and then Statistics.  
Work through this programme and then return to the same topics some time later to consolidate your understanding.  

How many integers are there between 1 and 10, inclusive of both 1 and 10?  
The answer is clearly 10.  

How many integers are there between 1 and n, inclusive of both 1 and n?
The answer is n.  

How many integers are there between k and n, inclusive of both k and n, where k\<n?  
Between 1 and n, there are n integers.  
We must subtract the number of integers between 1 and k-1, if we wish to include k in our final answer.  
Between 1 and k-1, there are k-1 integers.  
So between k and n, inclusive of the endpoints, there are $$n-(k-1)$$ integers.  

But $$n-(k-1)=n-k+1$$  

After Day1, our take away message is that inclusive of endpoints: 

<span style="color:blue"> $$\text{The number of integers between k and n is  }n-k+1$$</span>.  
Problem  
In a metropolitan area, a shopping mall developer has opted to create flexible working spaces.  
In one mall these booths for people to work in are numbered 204 through to 301.  
(i)Due to restrictions, just one booth in six may be occupied. How many booths are available?  
(ii)If restrictions are relaxed so that one booth in three may be occupied, how many booths are available?  
(iii)When all restrictions are lifted, how many booths will be available?
