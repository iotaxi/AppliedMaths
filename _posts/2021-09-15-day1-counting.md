How To Count

Day 1

You must study Probability before studying Statistics.  

You must learn How to Count before studying Probability.  

Learning to count is easy but you must take your time with the fundamentals.  

You will have a thorough understanding of counting if you work through a programme such as this  

and then return to the same topics some time later to consolidate your understanding.  

Let us start with this question and build up to something of value to us where we will use the terms numbers and integers interchangeably.  

How many integers are there between 1 and 10, inclusive of both 1 and 10?  

The answer is clearly 10.  

How many numbers are there between 6 and 10, inclusive of both 6 and 10?  

The answer is clearly 5.  

How many numbers are there between 1 and n, inclusive of both 1 and n?

The answer is clearly n.  

How many numbers are there between k and n, inclusive of both k and n, where k\<n?  

Between 1 and n, there are n numbers.  

We must subtract off the number of integers between 1 and k-1, if we wish to include k in our final answer.  

Between 1 and k-1, there are k-1 numbers.  

So between k and n, inclusive of the endpoints, there are $$n-(k-1)$$ numbers.  

But $$n-(k-1)=n-k+1$$  

So the number of integers between k and n inclusive of both is $$n-k+1$$  

After Day1, our take away message is $$\text{The number of integers between k and n, inclusive of endpoints, is }n-(k+1)$$
