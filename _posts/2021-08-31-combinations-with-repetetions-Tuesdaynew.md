Combinations with repetitions.

How many groups of n objects taken k at a time may be made if repetitions are allowed?

The solution is $${n+k-1 \choose k}$ or ${n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$.

To solve these, we must picture the situation.

Suppose you want to distribute 15 ham sandwiches to eight people, with no restriction on how many each person gets. How many ways are there of choosing how many sandwiches each person gets?

The answer is $${8+15-1 \choose 8-1}$ or ${8+15-1 \choose 15}$$.

So the problem reduced to n=8 and k=15.

Why is this?
