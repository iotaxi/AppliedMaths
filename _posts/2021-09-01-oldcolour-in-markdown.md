As it is not a "publishing format," providing a way to color your text is out-of-scope for Markdown.  
That said, it is not impossible as you can include raw HTML (and HTML is a publishing format).  
For example, the following Markdown text (as suggested by @scoa in a comment):  

{% highlight ruby %}
Some Markdown text with <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.
{% endhighlight %}
