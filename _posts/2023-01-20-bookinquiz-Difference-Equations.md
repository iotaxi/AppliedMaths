Difference Equations  
$${P_{n+1}}=1.052 {P_n}-3000$$  
is a difference equation  
$$where\:𝑛\geq0,\:𝑛∈\mathbb{Z\:}and\:𝑃_{0}=150,000.$$  
(i) Solve this difference equation to find an expression for $${P_{n}}$$ in terms of $$ 𝑛$$.  
In this difference equation, reference is made to one previous term, so ITERATION should work.
Write down the first term, then the second term and so on to see a pattern.
Simplify as you go. Write each term as a function of $$\:𝑃_{0}.$$ Do not evaluate numbers such as $$4^2$$.  

SOLUTION  
part one  
part two

When Cormac offes 5.2% with a 3000 Euro fee, we have seen that the value $$P_{6}$$ of Kate's investment after 6 years is given by  

$$ P_{6}=150000 {{\left( \frac{1052}{1000}\right) }^{6}}-\frac{(3000) \left( 1-{{\left( \frac{1052}{1000}\right) }^{6}}\right) }{1-\frac{1052}{1000}}\mbox{} $$  

We may deduce that when Ruth offes 4.3% with a 2000 Euro fee, the value $$P_{6}$$ of Kate's investment after 6 years is given by   

$$ P_{6}=150000 {{\left( \frac{1043}{1000}\right) }^{6}}-\frac{(2000) \left( 1-{{\left( \frac{1043}{1000}\right) }^{6}}\right) }{1-\frac{1043}{1000}}\mbox{} $$  

Using a calculator, we get  

$$P_{6}=179740.2100284243$$
