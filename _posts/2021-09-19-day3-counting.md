Day 3

NOTATION

$$n!$$ is read as n factorian and is defined as:  
$$n!=(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(2)(1)$$  
and $$0!=1$$  
where n is a non-negative integer.  

RECALL THAT:
The number of sequences of k objects chosen from a collection of n objects, where each object may be used just once is: $$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)$$  
But  
$$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)=\frac{(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots\cdots(1)}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots\cdots(1)}$$  
$$=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$  

THE SUBTRACTION PRINCIPLE
Suppose again that we have a collection of objects.  
$$\text{The number of objects that satisfy some condition = the total umber of objects - the number that dont satisfy the condition}$$ 
 
$$\#\,of\,objects\,that\,satisfy\,some\,condition$$

$$=total\,\#\,of\,objects-\#\,that\,dont\,satisfy\,the\,condition$$

where \# is read as number
