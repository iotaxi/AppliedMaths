Combinations with repetitions.

How many groups of n objects taken k at a time may be made if repetitions are allowed?

The solution is $${n+k-1 \choose k}$$ or $${n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$ .

To solve these, we must picture the situation.

Suppose you want to distribute 15 figrolls to eight people, with no restriction on how many each person gets. How many ways are there of choosing how many figrolls each person gets?

The answer is $${8+15-1 \choose 8-1}$$ or $${8+15-1 \choose 15}$$ .

So the problem reduced to n=8 and k=15.

Why is this?
Also follow up on multinomials such as $$\frac{n!}{a_1! \times a_2! \times \cdots \times a_k!}$$ which may also be written as $$\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \ldots , n_k}$$.
