Day 7  
COLLECTIONS WITH REPETITIONS
$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$       $${n \choose k}$$  
$$n^{k}$$         $${n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$     
 $$n^{k}$$  
The number of collections of k objects chosen from a pool of n objects with repetition allowed:

$$={n+k-1 \choose k}$$ $$={n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$

We have now considered the four formulae listed below
