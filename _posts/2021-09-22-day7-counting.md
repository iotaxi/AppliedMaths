Day 7  
COLLECTIONS WITH REPETITIONS  
The number of collections of k objects chosen from a pool of n objects with repetition allowed:

$$={n+k-1 \choose k}$$  
$$={n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$

We have now considered the four formulae listed below.  
Sequences without repetition:  $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$  
Sequences with repetition:  $$n^{k}$$  
Collections without repetition:  $${n \choose k}$$  
Collections with repetition:  $${n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$  

After Day 7, our take away message is:  
<span style="color:blue"># of collections of k objects chosen from n objects with repetition $$={n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$</span>
