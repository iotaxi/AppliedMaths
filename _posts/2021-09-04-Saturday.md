Suppose you want to distribute 15 identical balls among eight distinguishable urns, with no restriction on how many in each urn. How many ways are there of choosing how many balls in each urn?  
Picture one outcome: 3 balls in first urn, 0,0,0,0,0,7,5 balls in eight urn.  
Stars and Bars: s s s I I I I I I s s s s s s s I I s s s s s , which is 15 stars and 7 bars.
Number of ways is: $${n+k-1 \choose n-1}={15+7 \choose 7}={22 \choose 7}$$
Both $${n+k-1 \choose n-1}$$ and $${n+k-1 \choose k-1}$$ may be used. In the first case k is 15 and in the second case n is 15.
