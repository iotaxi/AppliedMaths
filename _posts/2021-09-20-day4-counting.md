Day 4

SEQUENCES AND COLLECTIONS.  
A sequence is ordered. Sometimes called a permutation or an arrangement, order is important.  
A collection is a group. Order is not important.  

COLLECTIONS  
The number of ways of choosing a collection of k objects without repetition from a set of n objects is given by:  
$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\times k!}$$  

THE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT  
The binomial coefficient is written as $${n \choose k}$$ and is read as "n C k".  
The binomial coefficient may be calculated using:  
$${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\times k!}$$  

After Day 4, our take away message is:  
The number of ways of choosing a collection of k objects without repetition from a set of n objects is given by:  
<span style="color:blue">$$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\times k!}$$</span>
