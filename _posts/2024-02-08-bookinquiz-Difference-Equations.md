Kate wishes to invest €150 000 in a long‐term investment scheme. Cormac is an investment broker. He offers Kate a guaranteed annual interest rate of 5.2% on her investment.  
However Cormac will charge an annual fee of €3000, which will be deducted from her investment.  
The value,$$𝑃$$, in €, of Kate’s investment after $$𝑛$$ years may be modelled by the difference equation:  
$$P_{n+1}=A\cdot P_{n}-B \;where\:n\geq0,n\in\mathbb{Z\:}and\:P_{0}=150,000$$.  
What is the value of A?  
What is the value of B?   
Use rational numbers rather than decimals.  

SOLUTION  
The annual interest rate is 5.2%. After 1 year, $$P_{n}$$ becomes $$ P_{n}+\frac{5.2}{100}\cdot P_{n}$$.  
But $${P_{n}+\frac{5.2}{100}\cdot P_{n}=P_{n}+\frac{52}{1000}\cdot P_{n} =\frac{1052}{1000}\cdot P_{n}=\frac{263}{250}\cdot P_{n} \\}$$  
An annual fee of €3000 will be deducted from the investment.  
After 1 year, $$ P_{n}$$ becomes $$ \frac{263}{250} \cdot P_{n}$$ but then the fee is deducted. We get $$ P_{n+1}= \frac{263}{250} \cdot P_{n} - 3000 $$.  
$$ A= \frac{263}{250} \;and\; B=3000 $$
