Day 2  
How to Count  

The Multiplication Principle  

Suppose that one operation may be carried out in M ways and that for each of those a second operation may be carried out in N ways, then the number of ways of performing both operations is:

$$(M)(N)$$

The two operations must be independent. Independent means that the first choice you make doesn't affect the NUMBER of choices at the second step.  
The Multiplication Principle may be extended to any number of operations.  

The Multiplication Principle allows us to conclude that:  
The number of sequences of k objects chosen from a collection of n objects, where each object may be used more than once is:  

$$n^{k}$$

The number of sequences of k objects chosen from a collection of n objects, where each object may be used just once is:  

$$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)$$

After Day2, our take away message is that we use the expressions below when applying the Multiplication Principle and when dealing with arrangements with and without repetition:  
<span style="color:blue"> $$(M)(N)$$ </span>   
<span style="color:blue"> $$n^{k}$$ </span>   
<span style="color:blue"> $$(n)(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdots(n-k+1)$$ </span>
