How many groups of k objects made be made from n objects if repetition is allowed.

This is difficult. One of the best approaches is to think grapgically or to think physically.

Suppose we have 3 objects: A,B,C

How many gps of 2 may be formed with repetition?

We may list all possible gps as { AA, AB, AC, BB, BC, CC}.

So there are 6.

In general, the solution in $$\dbinom{n+k-1}{k}$$ or $$\dbinom{n+k-1}{n-1}$$
